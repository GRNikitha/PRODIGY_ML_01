Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage 
and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
ðŸ“Œ Description
This project implements a Linear Regression Model to predict house prices based on three key 
features: square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. By analyzing historical 
data, the model learns patterns and relationships between these features and house prices, 
enabling it to make predictions for new properties.

The dataset used for training consists of housing details, including square footage, bedroom count, 
and bathroom count, along with their respective prices. The model is trained using Supervised 
Learning, where it finds the best-fit line that minimizes the error between predicted and actual 
prices.The project is implemented in Python using Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

By running this project, users can input house details and obtain an estimated price, making it 
useful for homeowners, buyers, and real estate professionals.
